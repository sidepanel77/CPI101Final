		<p>Curie is an AR Companion that appears in the real world through your smart device. She will be there to provide support and<br><br>
		positivity whenever you would like it and will send you messages periodically to see how you’re doing. Whenever you open the app<br><br> 
		she might be in a variety of poses, from relaxed, to curious, to pensive. In a world that is changing so fast it can be nice to have<br><br> 
		someone who can always be there. Through an augmented reality API Curie can appear anywhere you are. We use a normal-vector-based agglomerative<br><br> 
		algorithm to detect curved as well as planar surfaces in 3D point clouds to keep Curie on surfaces that make sense, avoiding the jumpy glitches<br><br> 
		that can be found with most augmented reality projects.</p>

		<p>More than just appearing as if real, Curie works to act as real as possible. Through tracking the pitch and tone of your responses to her and<br><br>
		cross referencing that to data about how these two qualities we will match Curie’s responses to yours. This is in an attempt to keep her at the<br><br> 
		most positive she can be. If your device has the capability and you give permission, your facial recognition data will be used to discern your<br><br>
		mood so that Curie can empathize and act accordingly. A sad mood and responses will bring a solemn but supportive response, a cheerful one will get<br><br> 
		a hopeful and encouraging response, etc. Later on, we hope to include an algorithm that tracks the trend of the user’s moods which would be used to<br><br> 
		augment Curie’s behavior accordingly.</p>
